- **Session Management**: Automatic logout on token expiration
- **Brute Force Protection**: Progressive delays and account lockout

### 4.2 Authorization Security
- **Role-Based Access**: Strict role verification on all protected endpoints
- **Resource Ownership**: Users can only access their assigned projects
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with request throttling
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries exclusively

### 4.3 File Security
- **Upload Validation**: File type, size, and content verification
- **Malware Scanning**: Integrate virus scanning for uploaded files
- **Secure Storage**: Files stored outside web root with secure access
- **Access Control**: File access restricted by project permissions
- **Download Logging**: Track all file downloads for audit purposes

### 4.4 Client Access Security
